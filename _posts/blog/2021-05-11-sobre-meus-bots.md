Many months ago I developed some bots for telegram, being \`@ndefinitionbot\`, \`@whatsinthisfoodbot\`, \`@ntalesbot\` and \`@ntextifybot\`, and recently I migrate all of them to become serverless so it becomes more available.

Bear in mind that since it's now using serverless functions at aws you guys might experience some cold starts, and for that... My apologies, I will be explaining what each one of them does and what you can expect from them.

\> \`@whatsinthisfoodbot\` Sorry for the long name, this bots uses EDAMAN api to fetch information about the food you input, I didn't really liked EDAMAN database, but it was the one I found. And here's what to be expected:

Querying "french fries"

Result

\> \`@ntalesbot\` This bot uses numbersapi.com to fetch trivias about numbers, being math, date or trivia related.

Querying "275"

\> \`@ntextifybot\` This is the most useless one, it just changes the looks of the message, makes it tiny, backwards, upside down and etc. Here's what to be expected:

So there's that, if you guys have any suggestions I'll be more than happy to hear it, feel free to use them in any way you want. I have spent more time on \`@ndefinitionbot\` than I wanted to and it still doesn't work as expected, but all of these were fun small projects and I hope it can be somewhat usefull for you.

Have a great day üíù
